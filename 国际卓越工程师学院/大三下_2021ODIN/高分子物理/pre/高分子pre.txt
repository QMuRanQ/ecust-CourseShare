Kakooei, S., et al. (2012). "The effects of polypropylene fibers on the properties of reinforced concrete structures." Construction and Building Materials 27(1): 73-77.
	In this study, the results of polypropylene fibers reinforced concrete properties have been presented. The compressive strength, permeability and electric resistivity of concrete samples were studied. The concrete samples were made with different fibers amounts from 0 to 2kgm−3. Also, the samples fabricated with coral aggregate and siliceous aggregate were examined and compared. The samples with added polypropylene fibers of 1.5kgm−3 showed better results in comparison with the others. Moreover, coral aggregate concrete showed less electric resistivity and less compressive strength in comparison with samples fabricated of siliceous aggregates. It is concluded that the coral aggregates are not suitable for making concrete or using in concrete structures in the onshore atmosphere.
